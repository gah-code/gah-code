# About

Hi there! I'm a web developer with a knack for creative technical challenges, particularly in content management systems and design-driven development. My journey in tech started before the pandemic, rooted in a background in photography and film, which continues to shape my approach to development. I'm passionate about building digital experiences that are both functional and visually captivating.

My work is driven by:
- **Creative Problem-Solving:** I thrive on projects that balance technical skill with a creative vision, leveraging design systems to enhance user experience and accessibility.
- **Content Management Proficiency:** With extensive experience in various CMS platforms, I streamline content workflows to empower editors and designers to tell their stories effortlessly.
- **Attention to Visuals:** My background in visual media informs my eye for design, resulting in a nuanced approach to web aesthetics and interactivity.

Let's build something beautiful and functional!
